The xml file to be parsed is events.xml

On the calendar grid page you will find a debug div that has a list of what was found in the xml. As far as
adding it into the grid, it will parse it and if it matches a pattern of having a year, month, day, title,
and nothing else it will take the info and store it in an array of dates. This array will be later parsed
and have those events added into the calendar
